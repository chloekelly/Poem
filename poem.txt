My poem:

I like interactive media.
So much so,
That I read more about it on wikipedia. 

But their defintion was very bland. 
So much so, 
That it was too sad to withstand. 

Interactive media brings me merriment, 
So much so, 
That I believe it is time to experiment. 

So follow along between the branches, 
to see how, 
This poem about interactive media advances. 

One branch I could chase, 
Could lead to new ideas, 
Of how our bodies interact with space. 

Here I find my self in a ghostly dream, 
Suddenly I am,
accutely aware of my body, the object and the scene.
