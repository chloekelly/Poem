My poem:

I like interactive media.
So much so,
That I read more about it on wikipedia. 

But their defintion was very bland. 
So much so, 
That it was too sad to withstand. 

Interactive media brings me merriment, 
So much so, 
That I believe it is time to experiment. 

So follow along between the branches, 
to see how, 
This poem about interactive media advances.
