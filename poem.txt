My poem:Definition experimentation 

I like interactive media.
So much so,
That I read more about it on wikipedia. 

But their defintion was very bland. 
So much so, 
That it was too sad to withstand. 

Interactive media brings me merriment, 
So much so, 
That I believe it is time to experiment. 

So follow along between the branches, 
to see how, 
This poem about interactive media advances. 

One branch I could follow,
is to create my own defintion,
However as my knowledge is still yet a bit hollow,
I think its best to rely upon some repitition. 

Interactive media is sometimes a method of communication in which the output from the media comes from the input of the users
Interactive media is sometimes discrete or continuous 
Interactive media is sometimes away of making the invisible visible

One branch I could chase, 
Could lead to new ideas, 
Of how our bodies interact with space. 

Here I find my self in a ghostly dream, 
Suddenly I am,
accutely aware of my body, the object and the scene.
